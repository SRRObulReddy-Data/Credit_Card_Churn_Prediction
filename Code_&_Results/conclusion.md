## Conclusion

- From the models I have built, it can be concluded that Random Forest is giving highest accuracy in predicting the credit card churn which is 92% whereas Logistic Regression is giving an overall accuracy of 89%.
- I have also performed multiclass classification model in which the overall accuracy is 89%. If we have a look at the overall error-rate, the error rate for Random Forest is less compared to Logistic Regression which even more implies Random Forest is best model for the dataset.
- After comparing the specificity and sensitivity too, the best model would be Random Forest. For the future scope, we would like to build the dataset for more advanced models and for an even larger data set.
